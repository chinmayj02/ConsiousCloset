            The pollution produced by the textile industry has a huge impact 
            on the planet, and reasons are quite easy to understand. Clothes 
            are probably the most common items that people buy in today's world, 
            and the average number of clothes that an individual buys every year 
            increased drastically in the recent years: a research from a 
            McKinsey & Company showed that the number of garments produced annually 
            became double since 2000 and exceeded 100 billion pieces for the first time in 2014.

            According to the Lenzing group, the world's textile consumption was 95.6 millions of 
            tons in 2015. Due to the numbers that the fashion industry generates, the impact on the 
            environment can be truly deep and damaging.    
            The main environmental problems caused by the textile industry include water pollution, 
            air pollution and solid waste pollution.
